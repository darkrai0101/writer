var postContent = "<div id='page1' class='page'><p>This policy sets out our privacy practices, explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use the medium.com website or the other Medium domains, products, services, applications, and content. When you use Medium Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other uses of your information as set out in this Privacy Policy. Please read it carefully. For real.</p><p>Let’s also state what’s probably obvious, but just in case: We don’t control what Medium users do. Their privacy policies and practices are up to them. If you share private information with other users, we can’t control what they’ll do with it. So be careful.</p><h2>What Some Shorthand Expressions Mean</h2><p>To make this policy more readable, we use some shorthand expressions in place of long, lawyerly chains of words. To wit:</p><p>“Medium”, “we”, “us”, and “our” mean The Obvious Corporation, which operates the Medium Services.“You” means you, whether you are a person or entity, whether you are using Medium for yourself or on behalf of your employer.</p><h2>The “Privacy Policy” means this document.</h2><p>“Medium Services” means the medium.com website, along with the other domains, products, services, applications, and content provided by The Obvious Corporation under the Medium brand name.“Third party services” or “other services” means any websites, services, and applications operated by parties other than The Obvious Corporation.</p></div><div id='page2' class='page'><p>“Agents” means service providers, consultants and other agents not employed by The Obvious Corporation.<h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2><p>This Privacy Policy covers how we handle information gathered when you use Medium Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our handling of any information that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners.</p><p>Importantly, this Privacy Policy only applies to us and our Agents. It does not apply to the practices of people other than us -- i.e., those of other services that we do not own or control. So it doesn’t apply to any non-Medium services that you choose to access through Medium Services. And it doesn’t apply to individuals that we don't manage or employ.</p><p>When we look at potential partners, we consider their privacy practices, and try to facilitate access only to third party services that share our commitment to protecting your privacy; however, we can’t, and don’t, take responsibility for anyone else’s privacy policies and practices. To protect yourself, you should also carefully review the privacy policies of any other services you access.</p></div><div id='page3' class='page'><h2>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>Account Information<p>When you create an account on Medium Services, you authenticate yourself through a third-party service, like Twitter. When you do that, you link that account with your Medium account. Once the accounts are linked, we may collect and store personally identifying information that you have provided to that third party service, and consented to having shared with services like us. Also, we store the email address that you provided to create your Medium Account.</p><h2>Email Communications with Us</h2><p>Occasionally, we might need to email you. We might need to send you some administrative info, tell you something important about your account or changes to our services, or update you on new policies. In really tough situations, like when we got dumped that one time, we might just need to vent about how unfair life is. Except for that last scenario, which won’t actually happen, these administrative communications are considered part of Medium Services and your Medium account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account information; if you receive such an email,send it to us, so we can take action against the evildoer.</p></div>";
